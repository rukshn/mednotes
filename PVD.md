# Peripheral vascular disease

**Definition** Narrowing of arteries and vains outside of brain and heart due to atherosclesotic plaques.

## Risk factors

* Age ogver 50
* Diabetes
* High blood pressure
* Hyperlipidemia
* Smoking
* Sedatory lifestyle

## Causes

* Commonest cause is atheroscelrosis
* Blood clots
* Diabetes
* Vasculitis
* Infections
* Strutural defects

## Classification

**Functional limb schemia** The patient has no problem at rest but has increased difficulty during work, presenting as intermitent claudication.

**Critical limb schemia** Perfusion deficiency at rest, resting limb pain, tropic ulcers.

## Symptoms

* Claudication
* Impotence
* Buttock pain
* Numbness tingling sensation
* Change in skin tempreture, color and coolness
* Infections that doesn't heal
* Ulceration and gangrene
* Renal faiure
* Uncontrolled hypertension

## Symptoms according to area involved

* Arotiilliac - Impotence, buttock pain
* Femoropoplitial - Intermittent claudication +/- plantar claudication
* Infrapoplitial - Plantar claudication

## 4 stage classification of PVD

* Grade 1 - Asymptomatic only detectable by ABI < 0.9
* Grade 2a - Intermittent claudication not limiting patient's lifestyle
* Grade 2b - Intermittent claudication limiting patient's life
* Grade 3 - Pain and parasthesia at rest
* Grade 4 - Established gangrene, trophic lesions
* Grade 5 - Circulatory ischemia

## Diagnosis

* Ankle brachio pressure index
* Doppler ultrasound
* Angiogram

## Management

* Surgical 
    - Atherectomy
    - Angioplasty and stents
    - Bypassing the affected area

* Non surgical
    - Excersise
    - Keeping the limb elevated
    - Lifestyle modifications : Good diabetic control, stop smoking
    - Promoting vasodialation : Applying warmth
    - Controlling hypertension
    - Medications : Asprin, Clopidgorel ( prevent MI, stoke etc)
    - Dietary : Low salt, low fat, minimize sugar intake
    - Lipid lowering : Statins
 
 * Medical
    - Cliostazol (phospho diesterase 111 inhibitor)
    - Ramipril (ace inhibitor)
    - CCB
 
## Newer therepy modalities
 
 * Polypill therepy
    - A Statin (to reduce cholesterol)
    - A beta blocker, ACE inhibitor, a dyuretic to reduce blood pressure
    - Foleic acid to recude homocysteine
    - Aspring to recude blood clotting
