# Neonatal Meningitis

## Neonates are risk of neonatal meningitis than other grooups because

* Neonates less than 32 weeks receieve less immunoglobulins than a term infant
* Inefficiency in alternative pathway puts them at risk of encapsulated organisms
* Inefficient t and b cell mediated immune mechanism
* Inefficient phagocytosis by neutrophils

## Etiology

* Most commonly caused by Group B streptococci.
* Then by ecoli
* Viral by HSV

Most of the time transmitted during labour. More in premature infants than mature infants.

* Risk factors for meningitis
    -   Prematurity
    -   Low birth-weight
    -   Chorioamionitis
    -   Birth asphixia
    -   Birth truma
    -   Premature rupture of membranes


## Signs and symptoms

* Early onset features (within 48 hours)

Most of the time are due to systemic features and not due to neurological impariment
        
   -   Tempreture instabilitiy
   -   Apnoea
   -   Poor feeding
   -   Hepatic dysfunction

* Late onset features
   
These are due to neurological involvement

   -    Seizures
   -    Extensor posturing
   -    Opistotonus
   -    Focal neurological signs
   -    Anterior frontanalle buldging
  
## Complications

*   Cerebral oedema
*   Cerebral heamorrhage
*   Venticulitis
*   Hydrochephalus
*   Increased intracranial preassure
*   Crerebral abcess formation

## DD

*   Head Trauma
*   Inherited Metabolic Disorders Overview
*   Intracranial Epidural Abscess
*   Intracranial Hemorrhage
*   Meningococcal Meningitis
*   Neonatal Seizures
*   Viral Encephalitis
*   Viral Meningitis


## Workup

All children who's suspected of meningitis should undergo a CSF examination.

The number of white blood cells (WBCs) found in the CSF in healthy neonates varies according to gestational age. Many authors use a cutoff value of 20-30/µL. Bacterial meningitis commonly causes CSF pleocytosis greater than 100/µL, with predominantly polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) gradually evolving to lymphocytes.

Septic screen

*   LP
*   Blood culture
*   Chest Xray
*   Urine culture
*   Full blood count
*   Acute phase proteins - ESR, CRP

Other investigations - CT, EEG, PCR highly specific to detect HSV virus.

## Medical management

Early intervension is nessesary to improve servival. 

In antibacterial therepy give peniccilin/ampiliccilin with gentamycin/cefotaxime for 14-21 days. Acyclovir for suspected HSV infection.

Corticosteroids for prevent complications of meningitis, not suitable for neonates.

Assess treatmet success after repeating a CSF full report 24-48 hours of starting antibiotics.
C-reactive protein levels can be useful in identifying the presence of a systemic anti-inflammatory response and can be used serially to track the response to treatment.

**Neisseria meningitidis or H. influenzae, seven days**
**S. pneumoniae, 10 to 14 days**
**Streptococcus agalactiae, 14 to 21 days** 
**Aerobic gram-negative bacilli, 21 days**
